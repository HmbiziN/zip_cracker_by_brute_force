# Zip cracker by brute force

This program allows you to perform a brute force attack to find the password to crack the zip.

### I've created this program to show how easy it is to crack passwords, and to encourage everyone to be particularly vigilant about their passwords. It's important to know that this type of attack can be extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive, and that we can easily protect ourselves against it.

## How does it work ?

Zipfile contains zip file management functions. Next, the user is asked for the name of the zip and the word list to be compared.

## How to protect ? 
- Use strong passwords: Encourage users to choose strong passwords that are difficult to guess even with a brute-force attack.
- Use a passphrase: Prefer the use of passphrases to simple words. Long, complex passphrases are harder to break.
- Impose password policies: Impose strict password policies, such as minimum password length, use of upper case, lower case, numbers and special characters.
- Limit login attempts: Impose account lockout mechanisms after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts, reducing the effectiveness of brute-force attacks.
- Strong encryption: Use strong encryption algorithms to protect ZIP files. Make sure the encryption you choose is reputable and resistant to attack.
- Use of password managers such as keepass
